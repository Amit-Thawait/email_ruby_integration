Gotchas :-
----------
1) All mail clients send the data in different manner

2) When to & from address is same then reply_to is ignored by gmail (not by outlook)

3) When replied to mail having a reply_to address some clients sends mail to the email_id converted to all lower-case letters (so, don't depend on keys set on reply_to having mixed case)

4) Some companies send their user's email with prvs tag as prvs=tag-value=mailbox@example.com
